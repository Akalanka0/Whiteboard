Project Title

Design and Implementation of a Distributed Online Whiteboard System Using Docker, Kubernetes, and Microsoft Azure

1. Introduction

With the growth of online learning and remote collaboration, digital tools have become essential for effective communication. One such tool is an online whiteboard, which allows users to visually express ideas through drawings and sketches.

This project proposes the development of a web-based Online Whiteboard System implemented as a distributed software application. The system uses containerization and cloud technologies to ensure scalability, reliability, and easy deployment.

2. Problem Statement

Traditional physical whiteboards are limited to physical locations and cannot be accessed remotely. Existing online whiteboard tools are often complex, expensive, or require high system resources.

There is a need for a simple, lightweight, and scalable online whiteboard system that demonstrates modern distributed software and cloud computing techniques suitable for educational use.

3. Objectives

The main objectives of this project are:

To design and develop a web-based online whiteboard

To apply distributed software system principles

To containerize application components using Docker

To manage and deploy services using Kubernetes

To deploy the system on Microsoft Azure Free Tier

To demonstrate software architecture and data management techniques

4. Scope of the Project

The scope of this project includes:

A browser-based whiteboard interface using HTML Canvas

A backend API to save and retrieve whiteboard data

A database to store drawing data

Containerized deployment using Docker

Service orchestration using Kubernetes

Cloud deployment using Azure Virtual Machines or AKS

The project does not include advanced features such as real-time multi-user collaboration or authentication.

5. Proposed System Description

The Online Whiteboard System consists of three main components:

5.1 Frontend

Provides a user interface where users can draw using mouse interactions. The interface communicates with the backend through REST APIs.

5.2 Backend

Handles requests such as saving and loading whiteboard drawings. It processes data and communicates with the database.

5.3 Database

Stores whiteboard drawing data in structured format for later retrieval.

Each component runs as an independent service, forming a distributed system.

6. Distributed Software Techniques Used

Service-oriented design

REST-based inter-service communication

Loose coupling between system components

Independent deployment of services

Horizontal scalability using Kubernetes

7. Software Architecture

The system follows a layered and container-based architecture:

Presentation Layer → Frontend
Application Layer → Backend API
Data Layer → Database


Additionally, Kubernetes is used to orchestrate containers, providing load balancing, scaling, and fault tolerance.

8. Data Management / Data Warehousing Concepts

Drawing data is captured in JSON format

Data is stored centrally in a database

Historical whiteboard sessions are preserved

Backend APIs enable structured data retrieval

Concepts such as data persistence and organization are applied

9. Tools and Technologies

Cloud-hosted application using Azure

Improved understanding of cloud-native development

11. Conclusion

This project demonstrates the practical implementation of a distributed software system using modern technologies. By integrating Docker, Kubernetes, and Microsoft Azure, the proposed system showcases scalable and maintainable software architecture suitable for educational and real-world applications.
